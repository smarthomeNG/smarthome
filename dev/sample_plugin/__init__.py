        use the SmartPlugin method get_parameter_value(parameter_name). Anywhere within the Plugin you can get
        the configured (and checked) value for a parameter by calling self.get_parameter_value(parameter_name). It

                        This means that when the items value is about to be updated, the call back function is called
