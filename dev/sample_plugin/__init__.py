        use the SmartPlugin method get_parameter_value(parameter_name). Anywhere within the Plugin you can get
        the configured (and checked) value for a parameter by calling self.get_parameter_value(parameter_name). It

        Default plugin parse_item method. Is called when the plugin is initialized.

                        where parse_item returns the update_item function when the attribute knx_send is found.
                        This means that when the items value is about to be updated, the call back function is called
                        with the item, caller, source and dest as arguments and in case of the knx plugin the value
                        can be sent to the knx with a knx write function within the knx plugin.
